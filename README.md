# AutoNetCan
AutoNetCan is an automated platform for cancer network modeling, integrating genomic data, enrichment tools, interactome databases, and Boolean network modeling for cancer research. Nodes are acquired from Genomic Data Commons (GDC), frequently mutated genes, cancer signatures, and therapeutic targets. Using Enrichr and MSigDB, acquirednode sets are enriched based on molecular and biological relevance. The network is built using the interactome data, mapping activation and inhibition relationships, from INDRA, TRRUST, SIGNOR, and Omnipath. RNA sequencing data and interactome maps refine the network into Boolean models, enabling simulation and analysis for therapeutic discovery.
